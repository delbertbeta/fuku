# Update Website Title to "Fuku"

## Problem

The current website title is set to "穿搭平台" (Outfit Platform), but the desired branding name is "Fuku".

## Solution

Update the website title (document title and metadata) from "穿搭平台" to "Fuku" throughout the application.

## Scope

This change updates:

- Root layout metadata title
- UI specification requirements for document title

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep bilingual title** - Could use "Fuku - 穿搭平台", but this adds unnecessary length
2. **Use domain-based title** - Could derive from domain name, but requires additional configuration
3. **Selected approach**: Simple, direct branding update to "Fuku" is clearest and most concise

## Impact

- Minimal: Single file change in root layout
- Affects browser tab title and SEO metadata
- No breaking changes to functionality
